## Problem definition
In order to have an efficiently organized warehouse, regular housekeepings are required. They mainly consist of rethinking the brands space disposition inside the warehouse.

For this task, I focused only on one level of the warehouse. My goal was to understand for which brands we should (or not) allocate more locations. 
Before diving into the analysis, let's first understand how the warehouse is arranged.
