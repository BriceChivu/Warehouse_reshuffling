In order to have an efficiently organized warehouse, regular housekeepings are required. They mainly consist of rethinking the brands space disposition inside the warehouse.

## Problem definition
My goal was to determine which brands were overflowed and which ones are not, so that we can reevaluate the locations attribution accordingly. For this task, I focused only on one floor of the warehouse. <br/> Before diving into the analysis, let's first understand how the warehouse is arranged.
